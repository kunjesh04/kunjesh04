My name is <b>Kunjesh Panchal</b>, and I'm interested in pursuing AI/ML. I'm currently a Student at Parul University (India).

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I'm also passionate about sharing my knowledge with others.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, hanging out, watching anime, and spending time with my family.
